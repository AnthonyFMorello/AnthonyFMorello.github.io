							<p>Seeing the previous website design, this project was initiated with a goal of updating the website to something more modern, clean, and functional.
                            This project involved remaking a portion of the company website, specifically with the goal of providing educational information to the public.
                            The design of the new website was self-developed. The website was developed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Updates to the website are periodic,
                            adding and removing events and images. The website can be viewed <b><a href="http://brickmua.com/metedeconk/Watershed.asp">here</a></b>.</p>
